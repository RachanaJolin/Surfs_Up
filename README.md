# Surfs_Up
I made a line plot(https://github.com/RachanaJolin/Surfs_Up/blob/master/Line%20Plot%20June%20Dec%20Comparision.png)  to compare the Differences between June and December- visually its obvious that December received a lot of rain. June is very consisent- there isn't much day to day variation in precipitation when compared with December. June would provide much better sales, as per the data. Decembers first 10 days are the worst for rain, but rest of the month matches up with June barring a very extra rainy days. 
I would compare the temperature data as well- if you're trying to sell ice cream. 
I added a line plot to make the data a little more easy on the eyes
